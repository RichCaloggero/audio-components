"York Minster is the largest medieval gothic cathedral in the UK and one of the finest in Europe, built between the 12th and 15th centuries on the foundations of the previous Norman church that was in turn constructed on the foundations of the original Roman fortress. It is approximately 160m long, 76m wide and 27m high to the vaulted ceiling, constructed predominantly of stone with extensive, large panels of stained glass windows. Its beautiful acoustic and setting make it a sought after and highly popular music performance venue."
