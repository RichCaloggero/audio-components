"Perth City Hall is a prominently-sited civic building beside the A-listed St John’s Kirk, and within Perth’s former market place. It was listed category B on 26 August 1977 and is within the Perth Central Conservation Area. It has been redundant since 2005. The memorial stone was laid by Lord Provost Cuthbert in 1909 and the design exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1912. The architects, appointed after competition, were H. E. Clifford and Thomas Lunan. Clifford was one of a generation of Glasgow-based architects influenced by the architecture of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and this is reflected in the building’s architectural style. It has coupled giant Ionic columns and sculptural enrichments, while the interior has a galleried large main hall and a correspondingly classical character. (Historic Scotland)
