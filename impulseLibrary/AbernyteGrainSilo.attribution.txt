"A concrete structure standing approximately 20m in height by by 5m in diameter the silo proved to have a fantastic reverberation quality close to 6 seconds from initial impulse to the sound dying away. Opportunist recording of balloon burst IR captured using an Alesis Palmtrack portbale recorder. Having passed this disused grain silo on the way to Errol brickworks I made a mental note to stop and explore on the way home. The silo probably a structure from the 60's or 70's is a typical cylindrical building but with a flat roof."
