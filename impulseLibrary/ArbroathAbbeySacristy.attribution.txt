"Arbroath Abbey is a testament to the integration of piety and politics by Scotland’s medieval monarchs. It was founded in 1178 by King William I ‘the Lion’, ostensibly as a memorial to his childhood friend Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was murdered in 1170. It also helped him to expand his authority in the north-east of Scotland, and to demonstrate his right to rule. William invited the Tironensian monks from Kelso Abbey, near the English border, to establish the monastery. When he died in 1214, his body was buried before the high altar. Traditionally, Scottish monarchs had been laid to rest at the royal mausoleum at Dunfermline Abbey. The legacy of William’s efforts is an outstandingly beautiful building. It has suffered much damage, but remains an important symbol and landmark."
